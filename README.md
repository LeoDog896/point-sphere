# point-sphere

this website visualizes proposed accurate-enough solutions to larger numbers of N for the generalized [Thomson_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_problem).

Many of these solutions propose fast, accurate methods towards providing stable configurations a sphere, but some generally prove better than others.

This visualization provides descriptions, analysis, and monitoring for each sphere method.
