# [point-sphere](https://leodog896.github.io/point-sphere/)

this website visualizes proposed accurate-enough solutions to larger numbers of N for the generalized [Thomson Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_problem)
/ [Tammes Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammes_problem) variant.

Many of these solutions propose fast, accurate methods towards providing stable configurations a sphere, but some generally prove better than others.

This visualization provides descriptions, analysis, and monitoring for each sphere method.
